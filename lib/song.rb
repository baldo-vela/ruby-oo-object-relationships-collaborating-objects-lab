        # 2. From here, we will create a new song instance using the song name we gathered from the filename.

        # 3. We'll also want to associate that new song with the appropriate artist. Use the artist attribute accessor to assign this

        # 4. Return the new song instance.

        # This method will do two things. Both of these things will involve collaboration with the Artist class:

        #     Turn the artist's name as a string into an Artist object.
            
        #     First we need to get the instance of the Artist class that represents that artist. There are two possibilities here:
            
        #     Either we have to create that Artist instance, or
        #     it already exists and we have to find that Artist instance.
        #     To achieve this, we'll need to collaborate with the Artist class. We want to send an artist's name (a string â€” remember we are getting this from the parsed filename) to the Artist class and either create or find the artist instance. This sounds like a great place to use method Artist.find_or_create_by_name.
            
        #     Assign the song to the artist. Now that we have the artist instance, we'll want to again collaborate with the Artist class by calling on the Artist#add_song(some_song) method.
        passed_name_string = Artist.find_or_create_by_name(passed_name_string)
